# How to add documentation

The generation of `html` from `markdown` depends upon
[`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org).

Get it there first.

We assume to be compiling the `md` files into a local directory named `htdoc`. This
directory is further synchronized to a remotre direcotry to publish the html files.

First some hypotheses:
- The structure of directories containing `md` files will be preserved under the
  location where it will be copied.
  For example, as of now, the result of the compilation file `tuto/mytuto.md`
  will be found under `htdocs/tuto/mytuto.html` 
- The directory `htdocs/apiref` will contain the documentation generated by
  `ocamldoc`. You can thus assume in your files that the API documentation is
  located under the subdirectory `apiref` of the toplevel directory.
  
  

## Example

Assume you want to write the file `tuto/mytuto.md`.

1. Create this file in the `doc_src` repository. Optionally write something.
2. Add the link to this file from `tools.md` 
3. Add `tuto/mytuto` to the target `MD_FILES` in `Distrib.mk`. Only add the
   basename, not the extension.

4. Run `make -f Distrib.mk html`
